# A Needle in a Data Haystack - Final Project
## By: Matan Cohen, Nir Schipper and Ran Shaham
We chose to write our project as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). 
This allows us to write nicely presented code and use interactive widgets to explore the data.

### Running Interactively
1. Download and install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Get this repository using one of the following methods:
  - Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/shahamran/needle.git`
  - Download it with [this link](https://github.com/shahamran/needle/archive/master.zip)
3. `cd` to the repo's directory
4. Create the python environment needed to run this project: `conda create --name needle --file requirements.txt`
5. Linux: `source activate needle`. Windows: `activate needle`.
6. Run `jupyter notebook`, and click the `Aliends.ipynb` file in the opened browser window.
7. Enjoy :-)
